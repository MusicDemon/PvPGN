PvPGN Back to Original ED
=========================

This edition has some minor changes that brings back the original version of Battle.Net v1.0.
That's the major idea.

So far what's been done;

- Moderated channels
- - Users can speak all the time but only Voice/Represetatives/Administrators can hear it.
- - Voice/Represetatives/Administrators can speak at all time.
- User flags
- - Administrators are given MF_BNET instead of MF_BLIZZARD.
- - Representatives are given MF_BLIZZARD instead of MF_BNET.

I'm not really sure what can be done more, though. So, please, come up with more ideas.
